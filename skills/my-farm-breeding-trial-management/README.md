# My Farm Breeding Trial Management

My Farm Breeding Trial Management is the breeding-operations skill pack for this repo. It covers how breeding programs move from experimental design to fieldbooks, germplasm handling, selection decisions, and crossing plans.

Use this skill when the problem is operational breeding work rather than farm-wide advisory routing or downstream QTL interpretation.

## What This Skill Does

- Plans breeding trials with common experimental designs like RCBD, alpha-lattice, and augmented layouts.
- Generates fieldbooks and operational plot artifacts for field crews.
- Organizes germplasm, pedigree, and accession workflows.
- Supports ranking, shortlist generation, and selection-index style decisions.
- Builds crossing and mating-plan scaffolds for the next breeding cycle.

## How It Runs

    accDescr: Overview of how the breeding trial management skill routes a breeding workflow request into design, fieldbook, germplasm, selection, and crossing workflows that produce operational outputs.

The skill revolves around a unified breeding CLI and example modules that map to the core phases of breeding operations.

This skill is the operational breeding layer. It is what you use before or alongside QTL analysis when the work is about running breeding programs, not only analyzing marker-trait associations.
