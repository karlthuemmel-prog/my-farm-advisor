# My Farm Advisor

My Farm Advisor is the farm-specific skill umbrella for this repository. It turns the upstream OpenClaw runtime into an evidence-first agricultural system that can rebuild farm data, analyze field conditions, generate operator-ready reports, and route day-to-day questions into the right agronomic workflow.

Use this skill when the request is fundamentally about fields, crops, weather, soil, imagery, reporting, or strategy. It is the top-level router for the farm domain in this repo.

## What This Skill Does

- Routes farm questions into the right operational subtree instead of dumping everything into one giant prompt.
- Connects field operations, data rebuilds, imagery, soil, weather, and strategy work into one coherent system.
- Preserves a field-level source of truth so summaries and recommendations stay traceable.
- Provides both quick guidance docs and deeper playbooks for repeatable farm workflows.
- Anchors the farm-specific skill layer that sits on top of upstream OpenClaw.

## Canonical Farm Data Structure

This skill is built around one deterministic storage model. The hierarchy is:

- `grower` - the customer or operating entity
- `farm` - a named operating unit inside a grower
- `field` - the atomic agronomic unit
- `asset` - the artifacts attached to a farm or field, such as boundaries, soil, satellite, weather, manifests, summaries, reports, and logs

## Deterministic Pipeline Entry Points

The farm skill is not just a loose set of guides. It also ships deterministic pipeline scripts that can rebuild or extend the canonical tree in a repeatable way.

```mermaid

    seed_source([🧱 Seed source files]) --> ingest[📥 Ingest and normalize]

- field posters: [`r2-seed-pipeline/src/scripts/reporting/generate_field_posters.py`](r2-seed-pipeline/src/scripts/reporting/generate_field_posters.py)

The most important high-level orchestration docs are:

- deterministic rebuild contract: [`data-sources/farm-data-rebuild/PLAYBOOK.md`](data-sources/farm-data-rebuild/PLAYBOOK.md)
- farm reporting pipeline: [`data-sources/farm-intelligence-reporting/PLAYBOOK.md`](data-sources/farm-intelligence-reporting/PLAYBOOK.md)
- runtime seed/bootstrap behavior: [`r2-seed-pipeline/PLAYBOOK.md`](r2-seed-pipeline/PLAYBOOK.md)

## Shared Resources

The farm tree includes a `shared/` layer for reusable datasets that are not specific to one field or one farm.

Examples already included in the skill tree:

- geoadmin layers under [`r2-seed-pipeline/src/shared/geoadmin/`](r2-seed-pipeline/src/shared/geoadmin)
- corn maturity baselines under [`r2-seed-pipeline/src/shared/corn_maturity/`](r2-seed-pipeline/src/shared/corn_maturity)
- soybean maturity baselines under [`r2-seed-pipeline/src/shared/soybean_maturity/`](r2-seed-pipeline/src/shared/soybean_maturity)
- shared manifest examples under [`r2-seed-pipeline/src/shared/manifests/`](r2-seed-pipeline/src/shared/manifests)

These shared resources support deterministic rebuilds and reporting without forcing every grower or farm to duplicate the same baseline datasets.

## Storage Modes

The same farm data model can run in multiple storage modes.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    accTitle: Farm Storage Modes
    accDescr: Storage options for the farm data tree, showing the same canonical structure running in local checkout, mounted volume, or object-storage-backed runtime modes.

    canonical([🌾 Canonical farm tree]) --> local[💻 Local checkout]
    canonical --> volume[📦 Mounted volume]
    canonical --> object_store[☁️ S3 or R2]

    classDef primary fill:#dbeafe,stroke:#2563eb,stroke-width:2px,color:#1e3a5f
    classDef support fill:#ecfccb,stroke:#65a30d,stroke-width:2px,color:#365314

    class canonical primary
    class local,volume,object_store support
```

The shipped pipeline/runtime docs explicitly support:

- local checkout mode: `data/my-farm-advisor/`
- volume-backed runtime mode: `/data/workspace/data/my-farm-advisor/`
- object-storage-backed sync paths such as S3 or R2, with `rsync --no-times` semantics documented for those mounts in [`r2-seed-pipeline/PLAYBOOK.md`](r2-seed-pipeline/PLAYBOOK.md)

The runtime installer in [`r2-seed-pipeline/README.md`](r2-seed-pipeline/README.md) resolves the writable data root in this order:

1. `R2_SEED_DATA_ROOT`
2. `/data/workspace/data/my-farm-advisor`
3. local checkout-relative `data/my-farm-advisor`

That is why this skill can work in local mode, bind-volume mode, and S3/R2-backed persistent runtime setups without changing the conceptual farm model.

## How It Runs

```mermaid

    accDescr: Overview of how the My Farm Advisor umbrella skill routes a farm request into the right operational area and then into guides or playbooks that produce field-ready outputs.

    class request,router primary
    class guides support
    class outputs outcome
```

The umbrella entrypoint is [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md). From there, the skill routes into one of the subtree indexes, and then into the actual guide or playbook that does the work.

This skill is the main farm-specific intelligence layer. The rest of the repository gives you runtime, channels, gateway behavior, and deployment. This skill tells the system how to think and work like a farm advisor.

## Data and Runtime Notes

- This skill suite ships large supporting examples and shared data assets.
- The deterministic scripts and data-tree helpers are part of the skill, not just external repo utilities.
- Canonical path helpers live in [`r2-seed-pipeline/src/scripts/lib/paths.py`](r2-seed-pipeline/src/scripts/lib/paths.py).
- Some workflows assume pulled large files or generated artifacts are available locally.
- The nested subtree documents are the real operating surface; this README is the map, not the full manual.
